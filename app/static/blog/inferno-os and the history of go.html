    This past academic term, I had the pleasure of taking
    a graduate operating systems course with Dr. Brian Stuart.
    In this class, we were taught both concepts about and methods
    for implementing aspects of operating systems. The course was
    driven by Dr. Stuart's book, Principles of Operating Systems.
    More information about both Dr. Stuart and the book can be found
    on his webpage

    The main focus of both this class and the book is the old and little
    known operating system Inferno OS.

    This operating system was a product of Bell labs, after the release of
    the

    operating system. It is small, portable, and relatively simple.
    Using this system as a tool for learning operating system concepts
    was a great experience, as we were able to easily go in and modify
    the system. The system itself is an interesting piece of software,
    and I would recommend learning more about it.

    The main driver of the Inferno operating system is what is referred
    to as the Dis virtual machine. This virtual machine interprets commands
    in the language Limbo and executes them. This language is what is used
    for all of the built-in user-space applications. When exploring the source
    code and looking at these applications, I began to see a lot of language
    features that I had seen before.
