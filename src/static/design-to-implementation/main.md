Like many other programmers, I got into coding because of the innate _need_ to create we all possess.
As a child, I was drawn to art and music, but lacked all natural ability.
I was very easily discouraged from these purely artistic pursuits, leaving me partially unfulfilled.
To fill the time, I played sports and video games, which successfully distracted me for quite some time.
In high school, I found that I could build things with my hands, which drew me to set design and construction.
However, the overtly ephemeral nature of these creations was downright crushing.
After spending months on a set to break it down in just a few hours, the hole was more noticeable than ever.
As the story goes, a love and interest in both math and technology naturally lead me to "discover" coding.
This allowed me to create complex things that _persisted_.
Since this beginning, I have struggled to make my creations meet my standards of quality aesthetics.

Once isolated, the issue became crystal clear:

_I suck at design._

## The First Step

As a young programmer, or as a programmer in general, most of your time is spent getting things to work.
There exists an idea, be it in your head, a company's strategy, or a friend's vision; and it will remain this way until acted upon.
Until recently, my entire perspective on these matters was wholly functional.
When discussing an idea, I was concerned with the approaches and architecture that would provide the desired functionality.
An _alarming_ amount of developers live in this bubble.
While this may be perfect for some, I painfully realized that this was simply not for me.
I tend to function best in an environment where I can understand a much broader context than I am engaged with.
This helps me conceptualize what I need to and enables me to start solving my subset of the greater set of issues.
In a professional setting, this manifests itself in the form of many questions, some of which are not directly related to my task at hand.
In most cases, this is well within the realm of reasonable.
Teams in which the individual members have a firm understanding of their role in the greater system tend to perform better.
This tendency becomes somewhat scary when presented with an open ended situation.
With not direction and no bigger picture to look at, I feel lost.
The first step was to realize this, and to understand that this meant I would have to define the parameters; _all of them._

## Iterative Design

Upon critical reflection, I understood that I did not like how I behaved when given this scenario.
I would define the narrowest set of parameters, and operate tightly within them.
This lead to poorly planned and thusly poorly executed ideas.
I would come up with one design and roll with it, often feeling like I am forcing a square peg into a round hole.
So, I decided that I needed to challenge myself on this.
I would go through an iterative design process.
By iterative design, I mean the process of creating a complete design, and the iterating back over the whole thing after some passage of time.
This process forces critical thought and action in design, and forces the actor to critically analyze the current state of the design.
I decided that I would redesign this website.
