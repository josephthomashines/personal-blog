Like many other programmers, I got into coding because of the innate _need_ to create we all possess.
As a child, I was drawn to art and music, but lacked all natural ability.
I was very easily discouraged from these purely artistic pursuits, leaving me partially unfulfilled.
To fill the time, I played sports and video games, which successfully distracted me for quite some time.
In high school, I found that I could build things with my hands, which drew me to set design and construction.
However, the overtly ephemeral nature of these creations was downright crushing.
After spending months on a set to break it down in just a few hours, the hole became more noticeable than ever.
As the story goes, a love and interest in both math and technology naturally lead me to "discover" coding.
This endeavor allowed me to create complex things that _persisted_.
Since this beginning, I have struggled to make my creations meet my standards of quality aesthetics.

Once isolated, the issue became crystal clear:

_I suck at design._

## The First Step

As a young programmer, or as a programmer in general, most of your time is spent getting things to work.
There exists an idea, be it in your head, a company's strategy, or a friend's vision; and it will remain this way until acted upon.
Until recently, my entire perspective on these matters was wholly functional.
When discussing an idea, I was concerned with the approaches and architecture that would provide the desired functionality.
An _alarming_ amount of developers live in this bubble.
While this may be perfect for some, I painfully realized that this was simply not for me.
I tend to function best in an environment where I can understand a much broader context than I am engaged with.
This helps me conceptualize what I need to and enables me to start solving my subset of the greater set of issues.
In a professional setting, this manifests itself in the form of many questions, some of which are not directly related to my task at hand.
In most cases, this is well within the realm of what is considered reasonable.
After all, teams in which the individual members have a firm understanding of their role in the greater system tend to perform better.
This tendency becomes somewhat scary when presented with an open ended situation.
With not direction and no bigger picture to look at, I feel lost.
The first step was to realize this, and to understand that this meant I would have to define the parameters; _all of them._

## Iterative Design

Upon critical reflection, I understood that I did not like how I behaved when given this scenario.
I would define the narrowest set of parameters, and operate tightly within them.
This lead to poorly planned and therefore poorly executed ideas.
I would come up with one idea of a design and roll with it, often feeling like I am forcing a square peg into a round hole.
So, I decided that I needed to challenge myself on this.
I would go through an iterative design process.
By iterative design, I mean the process of creating a complete design, and the iterating back over the whole thing after some passage of time.
This process forces critical thought and action in the process of design, and forces critical analysis of the current state of the design along the way.
To find this challenge, I decided that I would redesign this website.

## Less Talking, More Doing

As with every skill one can acquire, the only way to get better is to _do._
No amount of reading, watching, or listening to related materials will provide what the struggle of actually doing the work can.
Being the hardest path, I set out to do a full design of the site before changing any styling or structure.
Despite feeling like pulling teeth at first, I began to enjoy the process.
This project was the first time that I can recall entering a flow state outside of development.
This realization prompted a change in how I feel about my abilities to design as a whole.
Don't get me wrong, I still have _almost everything_ to learn, but I feel confident that I can break these problems up and attack them one at a time.
Given this personal realization, I also have a takeaway that I think is more important.
Now that I know I can enjoy the process of design, what is the utility?
Until I embarked on this project, I would have an idea in my head about what I would like to make, and then start coding to bring it to fruition.
Here's why that is a **bad** idea:

### Flimsy Concepts

By keeping the design as ideas, the nature of your design can change at will; sometimes seemingly against your will.
This lends itself to increasing the chances of a poor design, while also opening up the project to various software development related issues.
Feature creep and unpredictable deliverables are two of the main problems.
When the design is not concrete, we can easily allow it to morph without much resistance.
When an idea can change so freely, it would be next to impossible to define what the final product will look like.
By completing an entire design, the development process is constrained to just implementation of the design, not creation of new ideas.
This makes the final outcome more predictable, and prevents projects from sprawling into disarray.

### Unintentional Planning

As I was creating my design, I noticed that I was spending a lot of time thinking about what the style sheet and markup would look like.
Without the design, this process was almost entirely guess work.
Make a change, check the result, make another change.
Once designing was complete, I knew a large part of what I had to do in order to implement my design.
I knew what structure and style approaches would work best, not to say I was right every time, but that having direction made the process smoother and the resulting code cleaner.

### Acceptance Criteria

While this can be seen as an amalgamation of the previous points, I believe it deserves its own point.
By far the strongest aspect of working with a complete design was knowing when I was done implementing a certain feature.
Without the constraint, it is easy to allow modifications to sneak in, as the idea is weak.
Now, the design provides exact dimension, colors, and placements of all the elements.
Instead of being concerned with tweaking values, the implementation time can be spent focusing on the code and software design aspects of the project.
This leads to the conclusion: **Strong designs create strong software.**

## Wrap Up

Looking forward, I am excited to spend more time on improving my capabilities as a designer.
If you wish to see my work as a designer, check out my <elink to="https://github.com/josephthomashines/design">design GitHub repo.</elink>
As of writing this, the repository only contains my design for this site, but all future design files and projects will be checked in here.

Thanks for reading!
